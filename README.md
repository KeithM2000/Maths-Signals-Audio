# Maths-Signals-Audio

A codebase of custom classes and functions used to perform large computational tasks relating to mathematics and signal processing. 

The end goal of this project is to have a library of tools and data structures that can be used to solve problems
related to signal and audio processing, as well as strong mathematical/statistical functions and data structures, 
in a variety of programming languages.


Current Progress:
C/C++
    Math/Statistics
        Complex number mathematics.
            Implemented the Complex class
                operators +, -, *, /, +=, -=, *=, and /= implemented
    
    Signal Processing

    Audio Processing
